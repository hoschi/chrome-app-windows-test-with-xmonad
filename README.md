# Window State Sample

Demonstrates transitioning the window into minimized, maximized, fullscreen
and hidden states. Includes HTML5 requestFullscreen and app.window.fullscreen().

Tried to get a floating window within [Xmonad](http://xmonad.org), which is
resizable and controllable by code. Maximize and minimize medhots doesn't work
:(

Positioning is not accurate with xinerama enabled. Sometimes the window gets 'teleported' to the first screen.
